As of 25 February 2017 the initial release of the Corionis Service Manager (build 168) is complete. This version has all the basic functionality needed for a service manager. Additional user interface work is planned.

At this time it is limited to working on the local system only. Remote system management may be added at a later time.

There is still a lot of documentation to write. This site will be changing over the coming days.
