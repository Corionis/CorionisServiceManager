Changes made:

 * #2 Make sure CSM always displays within the visible display. Solution was to add tray option 
   "Reset position and size" that always places the window where it can be seen.

 * #6 Fix auto-start on Windows 10 & Server 2016. Added dialog that talks about the requirement for
   the "As Administrator" option on the startup folder shortcut. This cannot be done in the program
   so there is an option to open File Explorer on the correct directory so that tweak can be made
   manually.
   
 * #13 MSI installer not removing previous versions from Control Panel. One of the 3 digits of the
   version must be changed for an upgrade to work. The fourth position is ignored by Windows Installer.

 * #14 Select list Refresh blows-up. Fixed so the Refresh button on the Select tab works.
 
There are no other known bugs at this time.
