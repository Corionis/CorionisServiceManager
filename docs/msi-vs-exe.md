# Using the MSI installer versus just the .exe
The MSI Installer does a few things to make using the Corionis Service Manager easier. However it is not required, only
the simple .exe is required. So which you use depends on how you want to manage it.

## The MSI Installer:
 * Installs the software.
   * Personal or All Users option.
   * Install location option.
 * Creates a Start menu shortcut.
 * Creates an entry in Control Panel, Programs & Features.
 * Is upgradable as new versions of the installer are released.

## The .exe only:
 * Does not require installation.
 * Automatically creates the needed .ini file.
 * Creates it's own optional auto-start shortcut.
 * Is upgraded by simply replacing the .exe with a newer one, manually.
 * _**Does not**_ do the things the MSI Installer does.
