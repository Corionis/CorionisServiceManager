# What is the Corionis Service Manager?
Most people who regularly monitor and manage Windows services are only interested in a few.

The Corionis Service Manager (CSM) is a small Windows tray application that monitors and manages a list of user-selected Windows services. The selected services are monitored and may be easily started or stopped, the start-up type changed, etc.

Because it is a Windows tray app it is monitoring each service and always available. The utility may be popped up or down by double-clicking the tray icon. Notifications are displayed and logged when a selected service's state changes.
