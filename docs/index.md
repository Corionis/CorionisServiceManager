# What is the Corionis Service Manager?
Most people who need to monitor and manage Windows services on a regular basis are only interested in a few services.

The Corionis Service Manager is a small Windows tray application that monitors and manages a list of user-selected Windows services. The selected services are monitored and may be easily started, stopped, etc.  ![CSM in the system tray](res/ss-tray.jpg "CSM in the system tray")

Because it is a Windows tray application it is always avilable and may be popped up or down by double-clicking the tray icon. Notifications are displayed when a selected service's state changes.
