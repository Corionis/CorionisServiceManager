# What is the Corionis Service Manager?

Most people who need to monitor and manage Windows services on a regular basis are only interested in a few specific services.

The Corionis Service Manager is a small tray application that monitors and manages a list of user-selected Windows services.

All that is really needed is the "Corionis Service Manager.exe" program. It will create a localhost.ini file in it's directory to hold a variety of options and the list of selected services. But a standard Windows MSI installer is also provided.

[User Documentation](help) <a href="help">![Goto the help page](res/docs-icon.png)</a> is also the Online Help in the program.
