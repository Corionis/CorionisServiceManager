# Download Files
The latest version of CSM is **{{ site.version }}**. The buttons at the top of the page provide the same downloads as listed here.

The current version as been tested on:
 * Windows XP
 * Windows 7 Pro
 * Windows 8.1 Pro
 * Windows 10
 * Windows Server 2008 R2
 * Windows Server 2012 R2
 * Windows Server 2016

It may run on additional platforms but there are no guarantees
of course. In the words of old BBS shareware writers ... *"If you break it you own both parts"*.

**Note**: There is a *new* implementation available - [Corionis Service Manager.NET](https://corionis.github.io/CorionisServiceManager.NET)
that is a complete re-write in Microsoft C# and .NET and has a few new features. Check it out!

For the original version:<br/>
Windows MSI installer: [Corionis Service Manager_{{ site.version }}.msi](https://github.com/Corionis/CorionisServiceManager/blob/master/Corionis%20Service%20Manager_{{ site.version }}.msi?raw=true)

CSM executable only. This download is not an installer: [Corionis Service Manager.exe](https://github.com/Corionis/CorionisServiceManager/blob/master/Corionis%20Service%20Manager.exe?raw=true)
