# What Is The Corionis Service Manager?

Technically, the Corionis Service Manager is a Windows tray application for monitoring and managing selected Windows services. The user may select any number of the Windows services available on their computer. Various operations may be performed on services such as start and stop. The monitored list change color when a service's state changes. Notifications are displayed when something changes.

The program is written using [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/), a freeware BASIC-like scripting language. AutoIt was chosen for this project because:

 1. AutoIt BASIC is easy to learn and work with.
 2. AutoIt scripts may be compiled to a normal binary EXE program.
 3. When compiled there are no other dependencies or requirements.
 4. AutoIt is feature-rich and provides all the capabilties needed for the project.
