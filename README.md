# What Is The Corionis Service Manager?

**Note:** This is the development section of the project. If you just want to use the Corionis Service Manager go to the public site at https://corionis.github.io/CorionisServiceManager/.

Technically, the Corionis Service Manager is a Windows tray application for monitoring and managing selected Windows services. The user may select any number of the Windows services available on their computer. Various operations may be performed such as start and stop. The monitored list changes color and a notification is displayed when a service's state changes.

The program is written using [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/), a freeware BASIC-like scripting language. AutoIt was chosen for this project because:

 1. AutoIt scripts may be compiled to a normal binary EXE program.
 2. When compiled there are no other dependencies or requirements.
 3. AutoIt is feature-rich and provides all the capabilties needed for the project.
